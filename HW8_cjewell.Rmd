From the ggplot2 package, tidy up the "movies" data set, specifically r1:r10 and Action:Short.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data("movies")
movies

newmovies <- gather(movies, rating, frequency, r1:r10, -title)
newmovies <- gather(newmovies, genre, number, Action:Short, -title)
head(newmovies, n=10)
```

From the cafe data set, explain how would you tidy it up. Which variables?
